    "The criteria to assess prediction performance is RMSE. This performance metric measures the average distance between predictions obtained by a model and actual target values. Thus, the lower the distance (and the smaller RMSE), the better the prediction quality. It also has the advantage of being in the same unit as the predicted variable which makes it easy to interpret.\n",
