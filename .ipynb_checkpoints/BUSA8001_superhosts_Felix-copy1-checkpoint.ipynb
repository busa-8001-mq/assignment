    "### Forecasting Problem\n",
    "The goal is to predict daily rental prices of Melbourne located AirBnB listings. This information could be used, for example, to assess the rental price a property with specific characteristics in certain suburbs is expected to yield. Especially in a business case scenario, where these cashflows might be used to pay off debt, this is a critical aspect for feasability assessment. In addition, people interested in building properties specifically for renting them on the platform would want to know which property characteristics lead to the highest prices and the analysis of the data reveals such patterns.\n",

    "### Evaluation Criteria\n",
    "The criteria to assess prediction performance is RMSE. This performance metric measures the average distance between predictions obtained by a model and actual target values. Thus, the lower the distance (and the smaller RMSE), the better the prediction quality. It also has the advantage of being in the same unit as the predicted variable which makes it easy to interpret.\n",

    "These seem to have weak but existent relationship with log prices. instant_bookable and sum_amenities are positively related while property_type and neighbourhood_cleansed have a negative relationship. Thus, for property types the same logic applies as for room types and they might capture similar information. In the case of neighbourhood_cleansed it implies that the more listings exist in a suburb in the data, the higher its prices seem to be. Even though this is probably a weak relationship, but due to the construction of the neighbourhood encoding it seems to be the case. Further analysis is required with respect to individual suburbs as predictors of price.\n",
