    "The goal of is this assignment is to develop a model for predicting nightly prices of Melbournd based Airbnb listings with different features and characteristics based on statistical machine learning. The model can be used to assess the how rental prices differ based on specific characteristics of the property or against other suburbs, which can then be used to determine the profitability and feasibilty of certain listings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Criteria\n",
    "The criteria to assess prediction performance is RMSE. This performance metric measures the average distance between predictions obtained by a model and actual target values. Thus, the lower the distance (and the smaller RMSE), the better the prediction quality. It also has the advantage of being in the same unit as the predicted variable which makes it easy to interpret.\n",

    "Prices appear to be sensitive to property type, with <b>Private room in villa</b> having the highest mean price of <b>2358.36</b> by <b>property type</b>, which is much higher than the mean prices of other property types, suggesting that the distribution of prices for this property type may be highly skewed. <b>Private room in bungalow</b> has the lowest mean price of <b>64.11</b>. \n",

    "<b>Entire rental unit</b> have the highest listings <b>2984</b>, and a mean price of <b>296.87</b>, which is close to the overall mean price, while <b>Shared room in guesthouse</b> has the least listings <b>2</b>, and a mean price of <b>67.00</b>.\n",

    "<b>Boroondara</b> has the highest mean price of <b>894.95</b> by <b>neighbourhood_cleansed</b> and <b>Greater Dandenong</b> has the lowest mean price of <b>115.41</b>. Prices also seem sensitive to neighbourhood_cleansed. <b>Melbourne</b> has the highest listing of <b>2062</b>, and mean price of <b>335.35</b>, and <b>Greater Dandenong</b> has the lowest lisitngs of<b>32</b>.\n",

    "<b>Entire home/apt</b> have the highest listing <b>by room type</b> with a mean price of <b>312.19</b>. <b>Hotel room</b> and <b>Shared room</b> have the least lisitings with a combined total of <b>80</b>.\n",
